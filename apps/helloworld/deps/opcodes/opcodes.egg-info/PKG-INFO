        Opcodes Project
        ===============
        
        The goal of this project is to document instruction sets in a format convenient for tools development. An instruction set is represented by three files:
        
        - An XML file that describes instructions
        - An XSD file that describes the structure of the XML file
        - A Python module that reads the XML file and represents it as a set of Python objects
        
        This project is a spin-off from `PeachPy <https://github.com/Maratyszcza/PeachPy>`_ assembler.
        
        Current status
        --------------
        
        The project provides descriptions for most user-mode x86, x86-64, and k1om instructions up to AVX-512 and SHA (including 3dnow!+, XOP, FMA3, FMA4, TBM and BMI2). The following instructions are currently **NOT** supported:
        
        - All priveledged instructions and user-mode system instructions (e.g. XSAVE, SLDT)
        - Legacy string/streaming instructions (MOVS/SCAS/CMPS/STOS/LODS)
        - LOCK and REP/REPZ/REPNZ prefixes
        - x87 FPU instructions
        - VIA Padlock instructions
        - Intel HTM instructions
        
        For each instruction the following information is provided:
        
        - Summary description
        - Instruction names in Intel assembly (`PeachPy <https://github.com/Maratyszcza/PeachPy>`_, `NASM <http://nasm.us>`_, `YASM <http://yasm.tortall.net>`_ and MASM assemblers), AT&T assembly (GNU assembler) and Plan 9 assembly (`Go <https://golang.org>`_ assembler)
        - Operand types and characteristics (whether the operand is input or output)
        - Implicit input and output registers
        - ISA where this instruction was introduced
        - Whether the instruction operates on FPU or MMX state
        - Whether the instruction operates on AVX or legacy SSE state
        - Whether the instruction has no dependency on input values when input operands refer to the same register (e.g. `XOR eax, eax` has no dependency on `eax`)
        - Whether the instruction is supported by Native Client validator and when the support was introduced
        - Whether the instruction that writes to a 32-bit register is recognized by x86-64 Native Client validator as zero-extending
